# JallaConnect

JallaConnect is a shitty way to run commands on your computer from your phone over WLAN. This is seriously insecure and is not intended to be hosted outside your LAN, or by anyone else but me for that matter!

Seriously, this was made in 15 minutes and the only security I implemented was to only allow running pre-defined commands, which ironically can be added with a single POST-request with no authentication. Theres also a high chance of the application crashing by a malformed request (I guess, I didn't test it).

I made this because I wanted to be able to turn off my desktop computer without leaving my bed (yes, really). If you want more functionality you should seriously consider using KDEConnect (or whatever Windows or MacOS offers) instead.

For non-norwegian speakers: Jalla roughly translates to terrible.

## How to host this at home

Lol why would you? If you know a thing or two about hosting you should be able to figure out how to by using google. But seriously, use something like KDEConnect instead.
